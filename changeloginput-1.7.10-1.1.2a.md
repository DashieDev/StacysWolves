1.1.2 - Let Them Eat Cake
=======
* Made rare wolves slightly less rare and exempted village only wolves from the spawn cooldown timer.
* Check the block the wolf is standing in as well as the block the wolf is standing on for floor to allow spawning on snow.
* Slightly increased the maximum height at which lapis wolve may spawn and reduced their rarity.
