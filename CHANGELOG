1.0.8 - Bonemeal Bonanza
    * Bonemeal can be crafted using Stacy's bones. It gives a little extra, because these are especially nutritious bones.
    * Ender Ball recipe cost reduced.
    * Ender Ball is now reusable.
    * Fixed a crash when a biome entry exists that is null.

1.0.7 - Old Dogs can learn new tricks
    * Prismarine wolves now spawn in ocean monuments if Et Futurum is installed.
    * Prismarine wolves can now walk and breathe underwater. They will do so if there are any blocks within 30 spaces above them.
    * Fire wolves now always avoid water unless tamed.
    * Water wolves never avoid water, are not pushed by water and can breathe underwater.
    * Added the Wolfsbane Torch. May be crafted by placing a torch between Lilac or Allium flowers in the shape of a cross.
    * Wolves will no longer spawn within a 16 block radius of a Wolfsbane Torch.
    * Ender Wolves have learned to teleport. Untamed Ender Wolves will not teleport to a space near a Wolfsbane Torch
    * Reduced the chance that Stacy's Wolves will attack passive mobs. Your sheep are now twice as safe as they ever were. (from Stacy's Wolves, at least).
    * Added the Ender Ball. May be crafted by making a circle of alternating Ender Pearls and Eyes of Ender in the crafting grid. The recipe will be updated to require an Ender Dragon Egg in a later version.
    * Throwing an Ender Ball at Stacy's Wolves will capture them inside the ball.
    * Throwing the Ender Ball again will release the wolf.
    * Throwing an Ender Ball containing a Wolf at a creature will unleash the fury of the wolf (unless the creature is tamed by the person who threw the Ender Ball, or the creature is a Player).

1.0.6 - Fix Mah Server!
    * Fixed a serious issue where the wolf spawned on a server and the wolf the user sees on a client did not match.
    * Fixed a serious bug where the server would crash if items are spawned using cheat commands.
    * Fixed the display of the name of spawn eggs when spawned using cheats.
    * Water type wolves no longer drown when underwater for too long.
    * Bones now always show tooltips.
    * Updated some tooltips and renamed the bony bone to skele-bone.
    * Prismarine bone may now be crafted if Et Futurum is installed. NOTE: Prismarine Wolves will still not spawn.
    * Added a Very Important Person to the credits.

1.0.5 - Tip your caps
    * Changed most of the wolves to have their own spawn cap instead of using the monster spawn cap. Ore wolves also have their own spawn cap.
    * Prismarine Wolves are rumoured to have been spotted in the Deep Ocean biome.
    * Most wolves spawn only once every 400 ticks (just like farm animals). "Monster" wolves like Zombie and Bone wolves still spawn on the monster spawn cycle.
    * Mod no longer crashes when run on a server.
    * Wolf populations have been brought under control and should no longer overwhelm other kinds of creature.
    * Ore Wolves (except Emerald which only spawns in Mountainous biomes) have begun to encroach on the Jungle and River type biomes.
    * Monster Wolves have made incursions into Jungle and River type biomes.

1.0.4 - The cake is no longer a lie
    * Made sure cake wolves ONLY SPAWN IN VILLAGES!
    * Made sure cake wolves only try to spawn in biomes where villages may spawn.
    * Probably made cake wolves slightly more common as they almost never spawned before.

1.0.3 - Even more spawn tweakage.
    * Added Mushroom Wolf to the Roofed Forest.
    * Prevented Ice Wolves spawning in non-snowy cold biomes.
    * Made Flower Wolves spawn only in Plains, Sunflower Plains and Flower Forest seeing as there is no biome dictionary type called Flower.
    * Made wolves slower (Vanilla wolf speed instead of ocelot speed) and reduced max health as these are no longer dragons.
    * Prevented Iron and Emerald wolves from spawning on the surface under trees by making their max height 50 and they only spawn on Stone.

1.0.2 - More spawn tweaking
    * Earth Wolves spawn in fewer locations (for example they no longer spawn in Desert or Mountain type biomes).
    * Birch Wolves now are far more likely to stick to... birchy... biomes. No more Jungles, Mountains or Mesas.
    * End Wolves should no longer spawn in the Eldritch biome created by Thaumcraft.
    * Wolves will probably spawn a little less frequently as duplicate spawn registrations have been removed/reduced.
    * Blacklisted Nether and End biome types for any wolf that shouldn't spawn in those places.
    * Most wolves have had their spawn probabilities and max pack sizes tweaked.

1.0.1 - Bug Fixes, Breeding and Spawn Overhaul
    * Completely changed spawn mechanics to be more reliable.
    * Fixed some incorrect spawn zones.
    * Tweaked most wolves' spawn probability.
    * All wolves now spawn as "monster" type because the others weren't spawning at all.
    * Made it so wolves can spawn on non-grass blocks.
    * Blaze Wolves have decided to be 200% more firey and to live in Nether Fortresses.
    * Tamed wolves are no longer damaged by fire or sunlight.
    * Wolves now attack chickens, not creepers. No more 'splodey wolves.
    * Added Meaty Bone for breeding wolves. Different kinds of wolves will now breed with one another.
    * Wolves no longer sit if the player tries to feed them food but they weren't hungry.
    * Wolves are now healed for significantly more when fed.
    * Can no longer tame wolves with any old vanilla item.
    * Added tooltips to the various kinds of bones which (not so subtly) hint at which kind of wolf might like them.
