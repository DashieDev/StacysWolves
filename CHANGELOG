1.0.0 - Initial Release

1.0.1 - Bug Fixes, Breeding and Spawn Overhaul
    * Completely changed spawn mechanics to be more reliable.
    * Fixed some incorrect spawn zones.
    * Tweaked most wolves' spawn probability.
    * All wolves now spawn as "monster" type because the others weren't spawning at all.
    * Made it so wolves can spawn on non-grass blocks.
    * Blaze Wolves have decided to be 200% more firey and to live in Nether Fortresses.
    * Tamed wolves are no longer damaged by fire or sunlight.
    * Wolves now attack chickens, not creepers. No more 'splodey wolves.
    * Added Meaty Bone for breeding wolves. Different kinds of wolves will now breed with one another.
    * Wolves no longer sit if the player tries to feed them food but they weren't hungry.
    * Wolves are now healed for significantly more when fed.
    * Can no longer tame wolves with any old vanilla item.
    * Added tooltips to the various kinds of bones which (not so subtly) hint at which kind of wolf might like them.


1.0.2 - More spawn tweaking
    * Earth wolves spawn in fewer locations (for example they no longer spawn in Desert or Mountain type biomes).
    * Birch wolves now are far more likely to stick to... birchy... biomes. No more Jungles, Mountains or Mesas.
    * End wolves should no longer spawn in the Eldritch biome created by Thaumcraft.
    * Wolves will probably spawn a little less frequently as duplicate spawn registrations have been removed/reduced.
    * Blacklisted Nether and End biome types for any wolf that shouldn't spawn in those places.
    * Most wolves have had their spawn probabilities and max pack sizes tweaked.
